## **Abstract:**

The worldwide shortage of fossil fuels and emission norms in the automotive industry has 
increase the interest of people to make more efficient and effective engine. In order to 
make engine which follow the emission norms people increased their interest toward the 
alternative biofuels such as ethanol, methanol, biodiesel and many more. Biofuels have a 
capability to reduce NOx, soot formation and particulate matter (PM). By considering 
these it important to know the spray characteristics of biofuels under many injection 
strategies such main injection, pilot injection and split injection strategies. Before this it 
is important know that how spray characteristics affect the engine performance, emission 
and combustion characteristics. There are basically two types of spray characteristics that 
is  macroscopic  and  microscopic  spray  characteristics.  Macroscopic  characteristics 
generally focuses on the macroscopic parameters of the spray plume such as spray jet 
penetration length, spray cone length, spray radial length and spray area. Whereas 
microscopic spray characteristics focuses on the microscopic parameters such as spray 
droplet size, binned spray velocity and average Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD). There are 
various  experimental  methods  which  is  used  to  studies  the  spray  characteristics. 
Macroscopic  spray  characteristics  are  easy  to  measure  and  cost  effective  whereas 
microscopic characteristics are quite expensive and sensitive to measure. After studying 
these characteristics, it is important to know that how multiple injection strategies affect 
the engine performance and combustion characteristics.
